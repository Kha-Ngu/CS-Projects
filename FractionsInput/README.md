#FractionsInput
Built two classes (Fraction and FractionCounter) and a Driver class for use in counting the number of unique fractions read from a text file (all fractions should be positive).  
The project is to read in a series of fractions from a text file, which will have each line formatted as follows: “A/B”. 
Both A and B are NOT NECESSARILY whole numbers.  
The purpose of the program is to read one line at a time and build a Fraction object from A and B.  
For each unique Fraction seen, the program will create a FractionCounter object used to track the number of occurrences of that specific fraction.  
When all the input is consumed, the program will print out its ObjectList of unique FractionCounters, which should report the fraction and its count.
